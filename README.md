# Code Calendar
Code Calendar is a tool that allows you to input a date, which then displays the events that are happening on that day. You can then enter any additional event you remember, which the tool will save in its program.







# Motivation
the motivation behind Code Calendar was that I always had problems with remembering inportant events that needed to be done. Whenever there was a vacation or relatives visiting, I managed to forget up until the day before the vacation. With Code Calendar, This fulfills both purposes by allowing to see what is happening and then entering any other event happening on that day.
